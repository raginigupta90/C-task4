# C-task4
Assume that you have a binary search tree (BST) with unique  integer values stored in each node. Write a C++ or C program to  find the maximum width of the tree, which is the maximum  number of nodes that can appear at any level in the tree. The  program should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the  number of nodes in the tree.
